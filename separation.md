### Mechanism

**(1)** 1979, AC. Comparison of XAD Macroporous Resins for the Concentration of Fulvic Acid from Aqueous Solution.

  * XAD Macroporous Resins; five macroreticular, nonionic Amberlite XAD resins; 丙烯酸酯acrylic ester resins. 强吸附，强洗脱Highest recoveries were obtained with the acrylic ester resins which proved to be most efficient for both **adsorption and elution** of fulvic acid. 苯乙烯二乙烯苯styrene divinylbenrene resins. 扩散能力弱导致吸附弱，形成电荷络合物抑制洗脱Usefulness of the styrene divinylbenrene resins to remove fulvic acid is limited because of slow diffusion-controlled adsorption and formation of charge-transfer complexes, which hinders elution.
  
  * batch and column techniques
  
  * 洗脱效率 Elution efficiencies were determined by desorption with 0.1 N NaOH.
